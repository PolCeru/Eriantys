     * @implSpec The {@code toString} method for class {@code Object} returns a string consisting of the name of the
     * class of which the object is an instance, the at-sign character `{@code @}', and the unsigned hexadecimal
     * representation of the hash code of the object. In other words, this method returns a string equal to the value
     * of:

     * getClass().getName() + '@' + Integer.toHexString(hashCode())
