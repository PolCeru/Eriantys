### Rules not defined in Eriantys' documentation:

1) Coins are limited, if you pick one of them in a certain position in your board's dining room and after    
   playing a character you are with your students in that position again there won't be a coin there.

2) Mother Nature can take a complete a full circle of islands and return in starting position if last assistant played allows that.

3) In an unlikely draw beetwen two players if the third one was the ex winner he will keeps his position.
   
   Example: In island n.2 there is the following situation (no characters are played): 
   
   a) player one has the tower and one controlled student;
   
   b) players two and three have four controlled students each;
   player one takes advantages of this situation and keeps the tower after checking the next conqueror.

   An equivalent situation can happen with professors if a certain character, which enables removing students from dining rooms, is played.
   This can take to an "extreme" situation: if you have a color's professor with some students and all players lose all students of that color, 
   you will keep the professor without having his students.

4) Characters increase their price only after the first time they are used and they keep their new value during the match.

5) It's possible to have more noEntryTiles on one island.

6) Farmer effect (the second character illustrated in Erianty's rules) lasts one turn.
   
   Example: a) player one has two red students in his dining room ;
            b) player two has two red students in his dining room and their professor;
            player one uses Farmer's effect and takes control of red's professor, at the end of his turn if player one hasn't more red student compared to player two
            the professor will come back to him.
